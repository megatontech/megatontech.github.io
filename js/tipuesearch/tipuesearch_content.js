Spending a term with these guys would definitely teach me more about front end development since that&#8217;s all I would be doing! Well, that&#8217;s what I thought, at least. The first month has actually been an interesting mix of work. I&#8217;m supposed to develop the front end for key products using Angular, but outside of ensuring cross-browser compatibility, all of my development has been for miscellaneous (and unplanned) things!
