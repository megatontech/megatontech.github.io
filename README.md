Fork时就带的说明文档，现在并没什么用
# [codeinpink.github.io](http://codeinpink.github.io/)

This branch contains the generated files for my personal site,
[codeinpink.github.io](http://codeinpink.github.io/), built using Jekyll.
I build the site locally and push it to the master branch because I use my own
plugins for things like category pages, tag pages, and project pages.

My site offers searching and a contact form, both of which are typically not
found on static sites. To handle searches, I use [Tipue Search](http://www.tipue.com/search/).
For my contact form, I use [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). I recommend both!

To use my [Portfolio Generator](https://github.com/codeinpink/jekyll-portfolio-generator) plugin,
visit the [repo](https://github.com/codeinpink/jekyll-portfolio-generator)
for it. There you will find lots of information and examples!
